# Baby_Sleeping_Pattern_Analysis_ML

A machine learning-based system that analyzes baby sleeping positions from images or sensor data and classifies them into one of three categories: **on back**, **on stomach**, or **on side**. This helps caregivers ensure the baby sleeps in a safe position, potentially reducing risks such as SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).
